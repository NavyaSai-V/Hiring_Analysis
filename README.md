# Hiring Process Analysis

**Project Description:**

 In the given Project we are going to Analyze the Hiring Process. Here we have
the dataset where there are 6 Columns namely application_id, Interview Taken on, Status,
event_name, Department, Post name, Offered Salary. We are going to perform the analysis using
the Microsoft Excel. For better understanding the parameters of hiring process we have used
multiple Visuals using different graphs.



## Case Study Description

**Approach:**

We are going to using Multiple Excel Functions, Excel Tables, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts
in our Project to conclude to the Insights. First I have understood the dataset by clearly looking at the
Columns and the Values. Then converting the range into Table I have used many functions to get
the results I want. To summarize the data, I have used Pivot tables and Pivot charts.
## Tech Stack
I have used
1. Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016)
2. Microsoft Word (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016)


## Insights

**Outlier Analysis**
To Identify the outliers, I have used formulas and removed the outliers as True

**Class Intervals:**
 Draw the class intervals for salary in the company?
The output I got from Pivot Table

**Charts and Plots:** 
Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph (or any other graph) to show proportion
of people working different department?
